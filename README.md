## Testing

You must have a Project.java file for defining the four functions before inheriting them in the MyProject.java file. Once, you have done that you can test your code using unit tests.

Code must compile correctly when compiled with:

```sh
javac Project.java MyProject.java SampleProjectUnitTest.java
```
SampleProjectUnitTest.java is the unit tests file.

After compiling, you can test your code using the provided sample unit tests with:

```sh
java SampleProjectUnitTest
```
